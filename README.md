# Image_Classification with MobileNet and TensorFlow 
-> This project implements image classification using MobileNet, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It is designed to be fast and efficient while providing robust performance. The project uses TensorFlow and Keras for model building, NumPy for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualization.

# Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7 or later
2. TensorFlow and Keras libraries
3. Additional libraries - NumPy, Matplotlib
